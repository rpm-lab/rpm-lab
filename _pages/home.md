Welcome to the **R**obotics: **P**erception and **M**anipulation (**RPM**) Lab at the [University of Minnesota - Twin Cities](https://twin-cities.umn.edu/).

We focus on addressing the fundamental question of “What should/does/can a physical object in our environment mean to a robot?” thus leading to the following research questions.
- How can a robot perceive and reason about objects in the human environment?
- How can a robot interact with these objects?
- How can a robot compose its interactive skills into performing meaningful tasks?
- How can a robot learn to do all of the above toward seamless interaction and task execution?

We are interested in application domains (healthcare, climate change, etc.) where our research solutions can make a huge impact. 

**We are  looking for passionate new students to join the team** [(more info)]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/vacancies) **!**
