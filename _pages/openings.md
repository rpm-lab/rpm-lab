## Open positions

**We are always looking to work with talented students and researchers all around the world. Please read further and see if any of these categories fit the role you are looking to apply for.**


### Ph.D positions ([apply here](https://cse.umn.edu/cs/phd-admissions))
The [Robotics, Perception, and Manipulation (RPM) Lab]({{site.url}}) at the University of Minnesota-Twin Cities, is looking to fill multiple Ph.D. positions in the Fall of 2023.

We focus on addressing the fundamental question of _**“What should/does/can a physical object in our environment mean to a robot?”**_ thus leading to the following research questions.
- _How can a robot perceive and reason about objects in the human environment?_
- _How can a robot interact with these objects?_
- _How can a robot compose its interactive skills into performing meaningful tasks?_
- _How can a robot learn to do all of the above toward seamless interaction and task execution?_

We are interested in application domains (healthcare, climate change, agriculture, etc.) where our research solutions can make a huge impact.  

To answer the above research questions, the lab is interested in a wide range of research topics, such as:
- _Object Perception, Active Perception, Interactive Perception, Tactile Sensing, Multimodal Sensing, Sensor Fusion, 3D Vision, Neural Rendering, Implicit Modeling of Objects, Probabilistic Graphical Models, and Bayesian Inference._
- _Grasp Detection, Grasp Planning, Manipulation Planning and Control, Dual-arm Manipulation, and Mobile-manipulation._
- _Deep Learning, Self-supervised Learning, Object Representation Learning, Imitation Learning, and Learning from Demonstrations._

**We are looking for some combination of the following technical skills:**
- Proficiency in Linux, 
- Proficiency in one of the programming languages (C++, Python), 
- Experience with Pytorch or TensorFlow, CUDA programming
- Experience with ROS, Gazebo, Pybullet, other simulation environments
- Experience working on the real sensor(s) or robot(s).
- Experience with Blender or other designing tools.

Interested candidates must apply through the CS&E admission portal [https://cse.umn.edu/cs/phd-admissions](https://cse.umn.edu/cs/phd-admissions) and mention Prof. Karthik Desingh as a potential advisor. 
- For fellowship considerations, the application deadline is **Dec 15, 2022**. 
- The general application deadline is **Jan 5, 2023**. 

Applicants are encouraged to include a link to their personal website, project pages, GitHub code, and any multimedia supporting the projects in their CV. Candidates with relevant experience in the abovementioned areas and a healthy publication record are encouraged to apply. However, a strong preference will be given to candidates with publications (in the following or other similar venues: RSS, ICRA, CoRL, IROS, CVPR, ICCV, NeurIPS, ICLR, etc.) and-or experience in working with real robotic systems. 

In addition to researching on some of the most compelling problems in robotics, computer vision, and machine learning, successful applicants can expect to 
- Collaborate closely with other research groups affiliated with the [Minnesota Robotics Institute (MnRI)](https://cse.umn.edu/mnri).
- Collaborate with industrial research partners.
- Gain experience in teaching advanced topics in robotics and AI.
- Gain experience in leading research projects with a team of students.

### Master's research positions ([apply here](https://forms.gle/G3wX4ty8zEZsDfJTA))
If you are a Master's student at the University of Minnesota and would like to gain research experience in the areas that RPM lab focuses on, please fill out this [google-form](https://forms.gle/G3wX4ty8zEZsDfJTA). We will reach out to you if we have a project that matches your skills. 
Currently, we do not have funding for research assistantships for Master's students. We highly encourage students to apply either for a capstone project (1 semester duration) or a Master's thesis project (typically 1 year duration). 

### Undergraduate research positions ([apply here](https://sites.google.com/umn.edu/researchwitrpmlab/home))
If you are an undergraduate student at the University of Minnesota and would like to gain research experience toward graduate school application in the future semesters, please look into this [webpage](https://sites.google.com/umn.edu/researchwitrpmlab/home). We will reach out to you if we have a project that matches your skillsets. For funding please look into [UROP](https://ugresearch.umn.edu/opportunities/urop) and [REU](https://www.nsf.gov/crssprgm/reu/) programs. We highly encourage students to apply for a directed/independent research credit, where they will work on a project with a graduate student.
